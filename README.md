<h1>Dev's Note:</h1>

- Note that sometime in the future this will be sorted base on the how many objects are there in the game, including the platforms, colliders, animations scripts etc..

<h1>Updates</h1>
[Nov. 18, 2023]
- Removed the player collider (Doesn't need this)
- Removed the old camera movement (Am currently using a cinemachine for the camera movement)
- Added a camera zoom script
- Added smoothening to the camera zoom script



[Nov. 15, 2023]
- Fixing the camera movements
- Trying to fix on which the camera can freely move while the direction of movement is the direction of the player is facing
